@article{Inga2019,
abstract = {This paper addresses the planning and deployment of wireless heterogeneous networks (WHNs) for smart metering, based on a cross-layer solution. We combine the constraints of the network layer that considers routing and flow demands at each link in the WHN, while at the same time, we account for the restrictions of the physical layer referred to the capacity of a short range technology when used in a multi-hop fashion. We propose a model based on a column generation approach to solve the capacitated multicommodity flow problem (CMCF); the model includes wireless links capacities, coverage, and cost. The work integrates the multi-hop routing of packets in a mesh network formed by smart meters and concentrators connected to a cellular network via base stations. The traffic of each link is represented in a multigraph with the occupation percentage, and we build a scalable routing tree on a georeferenced map to represent a real deployment. The results describe the behavior of the proposed model in terms of the traffic load per concentrator, the network coverage, and the reduction of energy consumption. We demonstrate that an infrastructure cost reduction is achieved with the inclusion of multi-hop short range technology, which reduces the number of smart meters that require a direct connection to cellular technology. The model guarantees 100\% coverage of the smart meters analyzed in each scenario. The calculation time of the CMCF for advanced metering infrastructure (CMCF-AMI) based on the column generation algorithm as the population increases is reduced by 10\%, and this is the expected return when the population is considerable.},

@article{Inga2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a scalable route map for the least cost deployment of wireless heterogeneous networks that support traffic from the Advance Metering Infrastructure (AMI). We first explore the performance of a common scenario in which a single technology is employed to connect smart meters sending traffic to the Utility. Based on simulations with actual city maps, we study the coverage provided to smart meters by an LTE cellular network. In order to improve the coverage, an optimization model that considers network capacity and range is proposed to determine the optimal location of base stations to achieve a target coverage of smart meters. According to this preliminary results with a single access technology, we propose an evolved network architecture that considers several alternatives of wireless heterogeneous networks to guarantee the coverage to smart meters with the least use of resources. We introduce a heuristic model that involves elements from base stations, universal data aggregation points, number of smart meters, and an optimal routing to achieve the desired connectivity from the group of smart meters. We employ geo-referenced models to consider actual characteristics of cities as well as geographical conditions. Results from the evolved model demonstrates that by combining technologies and employing data aggregation points with optimized localizations, the network is able to achieve a target coverage of smart meters with a reduced cost in terms of technological resources.},

@article{Garcia2023,
abstract = {This paper presents a georeferenced optimal planning model of a rural distribution network for deploying an underground network considering a real scenario for increasing electrification in this area. A model is presented based on a heuristic process that minimizes the resources required to route the grid for a defined time horizon. Then, the model is scalable according to the population density, the established and georeferenced zone, and the specified period; that is, it adjusts to any of these variables. Additionally, the modeling is presented in CYME software, considering a series of technical criteria to provide the actual scenario with a verifiable planning model of an underground network. Therefore, the voltage drop and level of overload in transformers and feeders are considered to deliver an optimum power quality to the end-user. These results will be tabulated and presented as an alternative to different planning and design models that an electric distribution company may have to minimize the resources used in an underground deployment.},

@article{Inga2021,
abstract = {Citizens are expected to require the growth of multiple Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications to improve public and private services. According to their concept, smart cities seek to improve the efficiency, reliability, and resilience of these services. Consequently, this paper searches for a new vision for resolving problems related to the quick deployment of a wireless sensor network (WSN) by using a sizing model and considering the capacity and coverage of the concentrators. Additionally, three different routing models of these technology resources are presented as alternatives for each WSN deployment to ensure connectivity between smart meters and hubs required for smart metering. On the other hand, these solutions must reduce costs when this type of wireless communication network is deployed. The present work proposes various optimization models that consider the physical and network layers in order to integrate different wireless communication technologies, thus reducing costs in terms of the minimum number of data aggregation points. Using a heterogeneous wireless network can reduce resource costs and energy consumption in comparison to a single cellular technology, as proposed in previous works. This work proposes a sizing model and three different models for routing wireless networks. In each case, constraints are evaluated and can be associated with different real-world scenarios. This document provides an optimization model that encompasses all of the proposed constraints; due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, this would require a heuristic technique.},
